# NAPOS

The framework for a Flutter project.

## Install

Ensure you have Flutter and dart installed on your machine. 
- [How to: Set up Flutter and dart on your Windows machine](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows)

To use Flutter commands outside of a Flutter terminal, you will have to add the full path to the Flutter SDK in you path environment variable.

Use `> flutter doctor` to ensure your Flutter setup is working
Use `> flutter devices` to see the devices currently connected to your machine. This will include browsers.
Using `> flutter run` will run the project on the default machine.
You can specify which device you want to run it on with `> flutter run -d [device name]`
